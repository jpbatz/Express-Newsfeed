  Import Foundation settings:
  1. Copy settings from public/bower_components/foundation/scss/foundation/_settings.scss to scss/partials/_settings.scss
  2. Change the import statement
    from:
      @import "foundation/functions";
    to:
      @import "../../public/bower_components/foundation/scss/foundation/functions";
  3. Copy the following into scss/styles.scss
    @import "partials/settings";
    @import "partials/mixins";
    @import "../public/bower_components/foundation/scss/foundation";
  4. Restart gulp and save scss/styles.scss.  Verify that public/css/styles.css has Foundation styles.

  Run gulp, enable Live Reload in Chrome, and then make changes to jade files and scss files.  Make sure your changes are immediately reflected in the browser.
